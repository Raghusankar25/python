1) What is Python? What are the benefits of using Python?
 Python programming language is a general-purpose, interpreted, and high-level language that mainly offers code readability
 Benefits of python:
 -Easy to learn and use
 -Interpreted language
 -Crosss-platform language
 -free and open source
 -object oriented language
 
 2)How do you comment multiple lines in Python?
 """
This is a multi-line comment with docstrings

print("Hello world")
print("Hello universe")
print("Hello everyone")
"""
3)how to convert the Kilometers  to Meters?

 Python kilometer converter
km = 10
meter = km * 1000.0
print('%0.2f km is equal to %0.2f meters'%(km,meter))

output:
10.00 km is equal to 10000.00 meters

4)how to print a string number of times?
str='thundersoft '
printf(str*3)

output:
thundersoft thundersoft thundersoft

5)how to get the area and parameter of the square?
side = int (input ("Enter the side of a square: " ))
area = side*side     #Formula for Area of square
perimeter = 4*side    #Formula for Perimeter of square
print('Area of a square : ',area)
print('Perimeter of a square : ',perimeter)

output:
Enter the side of a square: 5
Area of a square :  25
Perimeter of a square :  20

6)how to get half string?
str="raghuvaran"
l=len(str)//2
s=str[:l]
s1=str[l:]
print(s)
print(s1)

output:
raghu
varan

7) Python is an interpreted language? Explain?

Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. 
Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages

8)how to get the integer input from the user?

input_a = input()
print(type(input_a))
input_b = int(input())
print(type(input_b))
Output:

10
<class 'str'>
20
<class 'int'>

9)how to define function and how to return a value from the fucntion?
def addNum(num1, num2):
    print(num1 + num2)
addNum(2, 4)

output: 6

def multiplyNum(num):
    return num * 8

result = multiplyNum(6)
print(result)

output: 48

10)what are the type casting functons in python?
a = 5
n = float(a)
print(n)
print(type(n))

5.0
<class 'float'>

a = 5
n = str(a)
print(n)
print(type(n))

5
<class 'str'>

a = "5.9"
n = float(a)
print(n)
print(type(n))

5.9
<class 'float'>
