1)What will be the output of the following Python statement?
"a"+"bc"
->abc


2) What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?
->An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python.

3)What will be the output of the following Python code?
x = 'abcd'
for i in range(len(x)):
    print(i)
a) error
b) 1 2 3 4
c) a b c d
d) 0 1 2 3
->option d

4)What will be the value of x in the following Python expression?
x = int(43.55+2/2)
->it doesn't give anything because the input is float but it declare with int.
->if we change float instead of int then output will be 44.55


5)Do we need to declare variables with data types in Python?
->No, in Python no need to declare variables with datatypes.


6)write a program to count no. of digits in a number?
num=int(input("enter num"))
count = 0

while (num != 0):
    num//=10
    count+=1

print("Number of digits:",count)
output:
entetr the num:23456
num of digits


7)Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms using loops? in pytjon
n = int(input("Enter the value of 'n': "))
a = 0
b = 1
sum = 0
count = 1
print("Fibonacci Series: ", end = " ")
while(count <= n):
  print(sum, end = " ")
  count += 1
  a = b
  b = sum
  sum = a + b
  
  ouput:
  Fibonacci Series:  0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
